            InfluenceHub is a platform that connects brands with vetted influencers 
            and UGC creators. Brands post campaigns, set their budget and deliverables, 
            and receive applications from pre-screened creators who want to collaborate. 
            InfluenceHub centralizes influencer selection, content submissions, revisions, 
            and payments—removing the need for email chains and spreadsheets.
